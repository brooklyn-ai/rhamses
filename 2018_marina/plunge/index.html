We invite you to join us to help raise funds for much needed playground improvements at <a href="https://communityhousevt.org/">The Community House. Community House, Inc.</a> is a nonprofit organization located in Brattleboro, Vermont. They operate a short-term residential assessment program, an Independent School, and a Summer Day Camp. The Community House programs provide a safe, happy, and nurturing setting for children in K-8th grades from Vermont and the greater Brattleboro community in southern New Hampshire. These children are in need of short-term residential treatment services or present with social, emotional and behavioral challenges that make it difficult for them to attend more traditional school and camp programs. The playground at Community House plays an important part in the children's day and is in need of some general updating as well as some additional play spaces that are designed for the older elementary and middle school children. Thank you for your support in this endeavor! 
(If paying by check please make them out to <a href="https://communityhousevt.org/"> "Community House"</a>.)</p>
